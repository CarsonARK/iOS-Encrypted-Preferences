# iOS-Encrypted-Preferences
Easily save and encrypt variables between app launches on iOS.
Allows extremely easy saving and loading of variables on ios objc/c++. 
You can choose to encrypt the names of the Keys and the Values saved into the dict to make it harder for other people to modify and mess with it.
Example in XCode using Im::Gui is shown, in objc++, works well inside Theos too however.

Example of an encrypted Save Value:

Without Encryption:

Key: testBool 
Type: String
Value: 1

WithEncryption:

Key: GAs5Cm5uIam79wnntuY+HA==
Type: String
Value: 0hZq0yAK91Jdcd/EiR2U8g==
